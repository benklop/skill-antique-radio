Left knob shuold control menu functions.

right knob should be play/pause on press, mute on long-press. volume on rotate.

volume level should be for internal speaker only  (at least at first), it might make sense to have a setting to change what volume controls.

volume level should be indicated with the pixel ring during control, and switch back to off after a few seconds.
